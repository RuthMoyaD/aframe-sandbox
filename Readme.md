# aframe-sandbox

---

A collection of experiments and prototypes built with **A-Frame**, the web framework for building virtual reality (VR) experiences. This repository serves as a personal sandbox to explore interactive 3D environments, VR components, and various capabilities of A-Frame in web browsers.

## About A-Frame

[A-Frame](https://aframe.io/) is an open-source web framework for building virtual reality (VR) experiences. It's built on top of HTML, making it incredibly accessible for web developers. You can create immersive 3D scenes with HTML, and extend them with JavaScript components for advanced interactivity and logic.

---

## What's Inside?

This repository contains various individual A-Frame projects, each typically residing in its own subfolder. You'll find examples ranging from:

* **Basic Scene Setup:** Fundamental 3D primitives and camera controls.
* **Interactive Elements:** Simple object interactions (click, hover).
* **Custom Components:** Examples of extending A-Frame's functionality with custom JavaScript components.
* **Asset Loading:** Demos showcasing the integration of 3D models (GLTF, OBJ), textures, and sounds.
* **Performance Optimization:** (Future additions may include techniques for smoother VR experiences).

## How to View These Projects

Since A-Frame projects are essentially static web files (HTML, CSS, JS, 3D assets), they can be easily hosted and viewed in any modern web browser.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)[your-github-username]/aframe-sandbox.git
    cd aframe-sandbox
    ```
2.  **Open a project in your browser:**
    Navigate to any project subfolder (e.g., `cd project-name`) and then open its `index.html` file directly in your web browser.

    * **Recommended:** For the best experience (especially for asset loading), it's advisable to use a local development server. You can use tools like `http-server` (Node.js) or Python's built-in server:
        ```bash
        # Using http-server (install with: npm install -g http-server)
        http-server .

        # Using Python 3
        python -m http.server
        ```
        Then, open your browser to `http://localhost:8080` (or the port specified by the server).
