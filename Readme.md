# aframe-sandbox

---

A collection of experiments and prototypes built with **A-Frame**, the web framework for building virtual reality (VR) experiences. This repository serves as a personal sandbox to explore interactive 3D environments, VR components, and various capabilities of A-Frame in web browsers.

## How to View These Projects

Since A-Frame projects are essentially static web files (HTML, CSS, JS, 3D assets), they can be easily hosted and viewed in any modern web browser.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)[your-github-username]/aframe-sandbox.git
    cd aframe-sandbox
    ```
2.  **Open a project in your browser:**
    Navigate to any project subfolder (e.g., `cd project-name`) and then open its `index.html` file directly in your web browser.

    * **Recommended:** For the best experience (especially for asset loading), it's advisable to use a local development server. You can use tools like `http-server` (Node.js) or Python's built-in server:
        ```bash
        # Using http-server (install with: npm install -g http-server)
        http-server .

        # Using Python 3
        python -m http.server
        ```
        Then, open your browser to `http://localhost:8080` (or the port specified by the server).
