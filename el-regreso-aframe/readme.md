# 🌍 Save the Earth – A Twine + A-Frame Experimental Game

This is a short **experimental web-based game** I created as a final project for my Interactive Narratives and VR course, combining [Twine](https://twinery.org/) for interactive storytelling and [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/) for 3D scenes rendered directly in the browser.

## 🦠 Story

A mysterious virus threatens the Earth.  
You are the last hope.

Explore, decide and act through branching narrative and immersive 3D environments as you try to save the planet from collapse.

## 🎮 How It Works

- **Twine** handles the story structure and choices.
- **A-Frame** provides interactive 3D scenes.
- Everything runs in the browser with no downloads required.

The project links Twine passages to full A-Frame HTML pages containing all assets, making the experience seamless and self-contained.

## 🚀 Try the Game

This is my **first project** combining Twine and A-Frame — if you're curious, give it a try! Feedback is very welcome.
